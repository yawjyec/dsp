[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

*cohen_d_totalwgt_lb = CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)*  
*print(cohen_d_totalwgt_lb)*  

The Cohen's D for the total weight in lb is -0.089 standard deviations, which is definitely higher than the Cohen's D for the pregnancy length. So the first babies are lighter than the none first babies.
